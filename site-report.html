                <h2>SITE REPORT</h2>
                <p>The goal of this project is to evaluate  proficiency in utilizing Git/GitHub to manage the code using HTML and CSS to develop a portfolio page that has at least five pages.And i believe to have achieved the goals creating my own responsive portfolio site containing 5 pages (home,portfolio,contact,work experience and site report).Each page has been briefly described below.</p>
                <div class="report-title">
                    <h3>Home page</h3>
                    <p> This was the first step to developing this site and was quite challenging figuring out the design,theme and style of the site as it would be implemented throughout.The background image itself was inspired by the nature around . this is the initial page and does not provide any personal information but has name and profession only.
                        
                        This is also where i designed my nav-menu which i claim to be the most difficult part of the site.This took me majority of my time to make through trial and error .
                    This is alos where i learned the most about the course and module and web-development itself.</p>

                    <p> This page initially has placeholder photos that will be later updated by term 2 and other modules' work .
                        at the moment it contains two photos and has a little  about me ending off with my skills.
                        this page is simple and doesnt contain any animations.</p>
